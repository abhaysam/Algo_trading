# Setup
We've already provided a `__main__.py` for this project and there should be no need for you to modify it. 

The 'demo' account config files for both Oanda and FXCM needs to be updated with your details, else the code will not work. If you need help inorder to setup a demo account or to generate the config file, feel free to reach out at abhaysam@outlook.com
