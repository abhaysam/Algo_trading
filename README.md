# Algirithmic Trading with automation and risk assessment

The idea is not only that you can show us what you've got, but also that you can get a first impression 
of what it means to build an index model.

The required input prices can be found at `data_sources\stock_prices.csv`. 

You can also find the correct (rounded) index level at `data_sources\index_level_results_rounded.csv`. 
Please note these values cannot be used as an input but solely act as a reference for you to verify 
your model. For the evaluation of your model we will use the high precision index values your model 
calculates.

# Setup
We've already provided a `__main__.py` for this project and there should be no need for you to modify it. 

If you want to use additional packages feel free to do so. The actual business logic must be part of 
your repo, but we actively encourage you to use packages that you're already familiar 
with. Please make sure to update the requirements.txt file accordingly.

# Submission
Please make sure that you clone the project instead of forking it.
